Smart cities are evolving, and more people are moving into urban areas, where it has been estimated that nearly 68% will live in these areas by 2050. For future goals, sustainability will need to be prioritized when starting new projects, which can be managed by focusing on innovative ideas that lower carbon emissions. This paper evaluates the Sixth Street Viaduct Seismic Improvement Project, a recent project that integrated sustainability into its design and reduced seismic safety risks by resolving the Alkali-Silica Reaction that had been causing the structure to deteriorate for 75 years. Along with achieving these objectives, the community's needs were met, a significant amount of public space and services were introduced, and community safety and security were improved.

Urbanisation is becoming more common in the world population. As smart cities are developing, so are the technologies that are created to improve our daily lives. It is anticipated that within the next few decades, the population will continue to migrate from being mostly rural to being primarily urban (7), where by 2050, it will be predicted that about 68% of people on Earth are going to live in cities, mainly occurring in developing parts of the world such as Asia and Africa, and by 2100, it will increase to 85% (1). A key foundation in developing smart cities is not only about the quality of life and innovative technologies but also sustainable infrastructure which provides a way of forming a climate-friendly environment that will continue to grow for a long time. The goal of smart cities is to enhance the urban environment by utilising innovation in all its forms, including technology, alternative ways of functioning, and potentially natural solutions (3). For our future, we need to change how infrastructure is made, planned, constructed and operated.
     </p>
	<p class="ex1">
Future cities will require more than simply cutting-edge technology and digital expertise. The goal is to lower carbon emissions while fostering the development of secure, sociable spaces where people can gather and have enjoyable lives (4). The goal is to increase cities' resistance to upcoming changes in the social, technological, and environmental spheres (4). Strengthening the communities where people live or work is not the only goal here. Rather, the long-term goal is to uphold and serve the community as a whole (4).

• Replacing existing urban infrastructure with new innovative and sustainable parts will make cities more inhabitable and inclusive. Over the next ten years, this would require a multi-trillion billion investment globally. However, if we take the proper actions, we will also see an increase in our economy. The following specifies the primary benefits of sustainable infrastructure (5): 
	</p>
	<p class="ex1">
• Lowering our carbon and environmental impact: The New Climate Economy suggests that over the next 15 years, better urban planning and more ecologically friendly infrastructure might prevent 3.7 gigatons of CO2 from entering the atmosphere each year. (5)
	</p>
	<p class="ex1">
• Promoting sustainable sources of energy: Utilising renewable types of energy like solar, wind and bioenergy will help shift our dependance of fossil fuels. By doing this, we can decarbonise the economy and create a digital power grid integrating more renewable energy, which will provide electricity for all the people that live without it.
	</p>
	<p class="ex1">
• Generating jobs in the green industry: By 2030, the estimated amount of green jobs in the renewable energy sector is likely to rise from the current 2.3 million to 20 million. (5)
	</p>
<p class="ex1">
• Driving green economic growth: Creating sustainable infrastructure is a fundamental component of the new economy that emphasises on action associated with climate change and sustainability. (5)

The Sixth Street Viaduct has been recognised with an “Envision Platinum award for sustainability”. The project's accomplishments include satisfying the needs of society, introducing a substantial amount of public space and services, and enhancing community safety and security.  The entire construction effort ended up costing $588 million (2).
	</p>
	<p class="ex1">
The original bridge was 3,500 feet long and crossed several train tracks, US Highway 101, several local roads, and the Los Angeles River (2). It included four lanes, each 46 feet wide, with 11 feet of inside traffic lanes and 12 feet of outside lanes without shoulders. On both sides were pavements that were of various widths. (2)

	</p>
	<p class="ex1">
The bridge was created with an on-site concrete mixing plant initially. However, within 20 years of its construction, the bridge began to deteriorate when the aggregate used in this facility experienced a chemical reaction known as the Alkali-Silica Reaction (ASR) (2). As a result, the 6th Street Viaduct has been deteriorating for at least 75 years. (6). Over a 50-year period, the probability of the viaduct experiencing substantial failure and possibly collapsing as a result of seismic events crosses 70%. Compared to the typically approved collapse likelihood of five percent or less over a fifty-year period, this vulnerability level is dangerously high (6). Seismic studies also revealed the bridge's susceptibility to an earthquake of substantial magnitude, and it was discovered to have an unsafe geometric design, which inevitably led to the decision to replace it with an improved design. (2)

	</p>
	<p class="ex1">
Following construction, the new viaduct satisfied its primary sustainability objectives, which included:
	</p>
	<p class="ex1">
• Improved safety and the eradication of seismic safety risks. Over time the deterioration of the bridge was due to ASR, increasing the probability of collapse during the earthquake. The new bridge uses the concept of seismic isolation which can be used against future earthquakes. This has been made possible since the Sixth Street Viaduct project has a design which is able to withstand seismic events expected to strike once every 1000 years. (2)
	</p>
	<p class="ex1">
• Creating a better quality of life for people using sidewalks/bike lanes, for example, the project was designed towards improving pedestrian safety and user satisfaction by implementing protected bike lanes, wider walkways, and landscaping along with numerous other improvements. (2)
